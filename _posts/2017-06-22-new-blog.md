After some time neglecting my old WordPress blog, I've decided to scrap it and
proceed with this new Jekyll-based blog on GitHub Pages. I've ported over some
of my posts that still seem to be helping people, albeit with some updates, but
I'm largely starting over.

I thought about writing something up, but this entire post would end up reading
like [Andrej Karpathy's entry](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-
to-jekyll/).
